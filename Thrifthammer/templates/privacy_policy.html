        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain your account</li>
            <li>To save your watchlist, army lists, and collection</li>

            <li>To improve the site's performance and content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use strictly necessary cookies only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sessionid</strong> — keeps you logged in during your visit</li>
            <li><strong>csrftoken</strong> — protects forms against cross-site request forgery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not use analytics cookies, advertising cookies, or third-party
            tracking scripts. No cookie consent banner is required as we only use
            technically necessary cookies.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Retailer Links &amp; Future Affiliate Relationships</h2>

        <p>
            ThriftHammer links to third-party retailers (including Games Workshop,
            Miniature Market, Noble Knight Games, Amazon, and eBay) so you can
            quickly find and purchase the products we track.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this time, ThriftHammer does not have confirmed affiliate or commission
            arrangements with these retailers. Some outbound links may become affiliate
            links in the future. If and when any such arrangement is established, this
            policy will be updated and applicable links will be clearly disclosed
            in accordance with FTC guidelines.
        </p>

        <p>
            All prices shown on ThriftHammer are for informational purposes only.
            Always verify the current price on the retailer's website before purchasing.
            Retailer ranking is determined solely by price — the lowest price always
            appears first, and no commercial relationship influences how products
            are displayed.
        </p>
