                    ThriftHammer is dedicated to helping the Warhammer community find the best
                    deals on the hobby games and models they love. Every penny saved on a kit
                    is a penny that can go toward the next one — whether that's more infantry,
                    a centrepiece model, or that paint set you've been eyeing for months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe the hobby should be as accessible as possible. The models are
                    already expensive — you shouldn't have to pay more than you need to. Our goal
                    is simple: give every hobbyist, whether they're building their first Combat
                    Patrol or their fifth army, the information they need to stretch their budget
                    as far as it'll go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We track prices across US retailers so you always know exactly where to buy,
                    when to buy, and how much you'll save — without having to open twenty browser
                    tabs yourself.

{# ── Who built this ── #}

        <h2 class="about-section-heading">Who Built This</h2>
        <div class="gold-rule" style="margin-bottom:var(--sp-6);"></div>
        <p>
            ThriftHammer was built by a Warhammer hobbyist who got tired of paying full GW retail
            when better prices were out there — they just took too long to find. After one too many
            trips down a rabbit hole of browser tabs, spreadsheets, and Reddit threads, the decision
            was made to just build the tool that should already exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an independent project with no affiliation to Games Workshop, Citadel Miniatures,
            or any of the retailers we track. It's free to use and always will be. If affiliate
            commissions are earned when you click through to a retailer, that money goes directly
            back into keeping the site running.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're a community project at heart. If you have feedback, feature requests, or spot a
            price that looks wrong, reach out — we want to hear from you.
