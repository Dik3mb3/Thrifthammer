                    ThriftHammer is dedicated to helping the Warhammer community find the best
                    deals on the hobby games and models they love. Every penny saved on a kit
                    is a penny that can go toward the next one — whether that's more infantry,
                    a centrepiece model, or that paint set you've been eyeing for months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe the hobby should be as accessible as possible. The models are
                    already expensive — you shouldn't have to pay more than you need to. Our goal
                    is simple: give every hobbyist, whether they're building their first Combat
                    Patrol or their fifth army, the information they need to stretch their budget
                    as far as it'll go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We track prices across US retailers so you always know exactly where to buy,
                    when to buy, and how much you'll save — without having to open twenty browser
                    tabs yourself.

                    We monitor prices from Miniature Market, Noble Knight Games, eBay,
                    Amazon, and Games Workshop itself. Every product page shows you a live side-by-side
                    comparison so the best deal is always obvious at a glance.

                    No more manually checking retailer sites every week hoping something has gone
                    on sale — we do the watching so you can focus on painting.

                        We want to find ways to shine a light on local retailers and support the
                        FLGSs that make this hobby more than just a transaction. The details are
                        still being worked out, but keeping the community strong is something we
                        care deeply about.

        <h2 class="about-section-heading">Who Built This</h2>
        <div class="gold-rule" style="margin-bottom:var(--sp-6);"></div>
        <p>
            Hi — I'm the person behind ThriftHammer. I'm a relatively new player to the hobby,
            been in the community for a few years now. I predominantly play <strong style="color:var(--accent-gold-lt);">Orks</strong>
            (Waagh!), but I've expanded my collection into
            <strong style="color:var(--accent-gold-lt);">Grey Knights</strong>,
            <strong style="color:var(--accent-gold-lt);">T'au</strong>, and
            <strong style="color:var(--accent-gold-lt);">Necrons</strong> along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently married and just recently had a beautiful baby boy who I hope to share
            this hobby with as he gets older — maybe he'll be rolling dice across from me one day.
        </p>
        <p>
            ThriftHammer was born out of my own early struggles navigating what is an amazing but
            very expensive hobby. I spent too many hours jumping between browser tabs trying to
            figure out where to get the best price on a kit. I figured if I needed this tool,
            others probably did too — so I built it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this site is successful, I hope to reinvest any proceeds from affiliates into new
            tools and features for all our users. I hope you join me on this journey. Please reach
            out if you spot any pricing errors, bugs, or just want to say hello — I genuinely want
            to hear from you.
