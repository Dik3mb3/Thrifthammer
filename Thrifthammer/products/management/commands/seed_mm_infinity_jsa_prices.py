"""
Seed Miniature Market US prices and the USD MSRP for Infinity: JSA.

Uses the existing `miniature-market` Retailer (US, is_uk=False) -- does not
create it, matching every other Miniature Market seed command.

Source: user-supplied "Infinity U.S Miniature Market.xlsx" (Title/Title_URL/
Keywords/Price columns). Each sheet row carries two numbers, used as follows
(explicit user instruction, 2026-10-02):

- "Retail Price" is the Corvus Belli US MSRP shown to users -> Product.msrp
  (USD; the MSRP and discount baseline on US pages when a product has no Games
  Workshop row) AND the price of the Corvus Belli US row (retailer
  `corvus-belli`, the same official URL as the UK `corvus-belli-uk` row,
  created by seed_corvus_belli_infinity_us_links).
- "Price" is Miniature Market's own, lower selling price -> the
  `miniature-market` CurrentPrice price, with the sheet's link as its url.

Both writes are create-only (a value is only written while it is still None /
the row does not exist yet), so a redeploy never resets an MSRP or a price
the Miniature Market scraper has since refreshed. in_stock is the live stock
status of each listing checked on 2026-10-02 (JSA-001 and JSA-003 were in
stock, the rest out of stock, which keeps their real price with
in_stock=False and not_available=False). The scraper corrects stock on its
next run.

Every match was made by reading, not by script, every URL was fetched live and
its page title and price confirmed against the sheet, and the matches were
confirmed with the user (2026-10-02).

All 5 JSA SKUs matched; none missing.

Notes on individual picks (all confirmed with the user):
- JSA-001 Infinity JSA Paint Set is MM's "JSA - Paint Set with Keisotsu
  Paramedic" (the same Keisotsu set confirmed on the UK side).
- JSA-005 Reinforcements: JSA Pack Alpha is MM's "NA2 - JSA Reinforcements Pack
  Alpha", the only JSA reinforcements pack in the sheet (MM files it under
  "NA2").

Run once on Railway startup via Procfile. Safe to re-run -- idempotent.
